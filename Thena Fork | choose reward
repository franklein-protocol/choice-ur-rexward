Implementing bridge low fees auto. pretty dangerous , slippag edam too high. I guess , people choice have a web page where there a ranking of APY reward / bcv 
Need tier service for efficient the bacxk test. implement it real is only solutions to avoid major tech hack in long term
find a new testnet to deploy contract 

need to implment safe gaz , Probably a chain like base ca&n provide this type of
